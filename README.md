 Design project for a USB controlled VHF/UHF transmitter.

 This is a project laying out the basis for a circuit board containing a USB Audio Interface which is able to output to a VHF or UHF 1W FM transmitter. Transmitter will be able to be programmed to do various tasks however I intend to develop it with APRS in mind.
